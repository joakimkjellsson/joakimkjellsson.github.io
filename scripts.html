<h2 class="jtkHeader">Scripts</h2>

<p class="jtkText">
NOTE: This page is very much in construction. The plan is to upload a few of the scripts I've 
used in some papers. 
It is nowhere near a complete list. 
Bear in mind that most of them have no documentation and very few comments. 
I'm happy share scripts and a bit of help upon request.

<h2 class="jtkHeader">Stream functions in various coordinates</h2>

<p class="jtkText">This is the code that was used for the 
<a href="http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/abs/10.1175/JAS-D-13-0173.1" target="_blank">Kjellsson et al. (2014)</a> and 
<a href="http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00382-014-2337-8" target="_blank">Kjellsson (2015)</a> papers. 
It is written in Fortran 90 with OpenMP shared-memory parallelisation and netCDF4 input/outputs. 
It also uses CDO to convert or interpolate data where necessary. 
It reads in ERA-Interim and CMIP5 atmosphere data to calculate stream functions in 
a wide range of different coordinate systems. </p>

<h2 class="jtkHeader">Barotropic, linear shallow water model with MPI</h2>

<p class="jtkText">This code was written by me and Abubakr Salih for a project on high-performance computing. 
We used it to test scalability and performance on various supercomputers and compilers. 
netCDF module was written by Laurent Brodeau. </p>
